Automation: Create automated testing scripts to streamline and scale ETL testing processes.
Regression Testing: Perform regression testing when changes are made to ETL processes to ensure new changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.
Performance Testing: Assess the performance of ETL processes, ensuring they meet performance standards under various loads.
Defect Management: Log, track, and manage defects discovered during testing, working with ETL developers to resolve issues.
Reporting: Generate test summary reports, detailing the results of ETL testing and highlighting any issues or areas for improvement.
